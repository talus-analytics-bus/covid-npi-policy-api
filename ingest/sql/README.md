# Shell scripts
The shell scripts in this folder update COVID AMP's data in a local database
whose name you provide.

# SQL scripts
The SQL scripts in this folder are either called directly by the Python code
during the ingest process, or they may be run manually in specific QA/QC
situations that are not expected to arise. In the latter case, the SQL files
are saved in this folder for posterity, and they may be removed in the future
if no longer used.
